r template set

This template set serves as an example for how to use templator.

Run with:

    :Templator [*][PATH/]r [NAME] [runit=1]

The first argument is a name that defaults to "main". The name is used 
in several locations in the template files.

If runit is true, the runit library is used for testing. If not, the 
testthat library is used.

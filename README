The templator plugin allows the creation of multi-file templates. Templates could 
be written in any code template/skeleton/snippets style. At the time of 
writing, only tskeleton-style templates (vimscript #1160) are supported though. 
(See |g:templator#expanders| for how to enable additional template engines.)

The |:Templator| command can be used to create multi-file projects.

Example 1: Create files for the "test" template-set in the current directory: >

    :Templator test

Example 2: Create files for the "test" template-set in some directory (the 
directory is created if it doesn't already exist): >

    :Templator ~/src/foo/bar/test

Templates are kept in "templator" subdirectories in your 'runtimepath' (e.g. 
~/.vim/templator). A subdirectory's name consists of 
"TEMPLATE_NAME.TEMPLATE_TYPE". TEMPLATE_NAME is the name that is used for the 
|:Templator| command. TEMPLATE_TYPE is the name of the template engine used to 
expand file templates.

Templates consist of a bunch of files and an optional vim script that is run 
after creating the files.
